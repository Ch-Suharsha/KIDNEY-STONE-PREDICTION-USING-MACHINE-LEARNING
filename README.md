# KIDNEY-STONE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

Data mining methods and machine learning play a major role in this aspect of biosciences. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as they always do. A family history of kidney diseases or failure, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes may lead to CKD This is a lasting damage to the kidney and chances of getting worse by time is high. The very common problems that results due to a kidney failure are heart diseases, anaemia, bone diseases, high potassium and calcium. The worst-case situation leads to complete kidney failure and necessitates kidney transplant to live. An early detection of CKD can increase the quality of life to a greater extent. This calls for good prediction algorithm to predict CKD at an earlier stage. Literature shows a wide range of machine learning algorithms employed for the prediction of CKD. This paper uses data pre-processing, data transformation and various classifiers to predict CKD and also proposes best Prediction framework for CKD. The results of the framework show promising results of better prediction at an early stage of CKD.

- **Data Collection:**
  - 400 records from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  - After cleaning, 220 records remained.
  - 25 attributes, including numerical (e.g., age, blood pressure) and nominal (e.g., specific gravity) attributes.
  - Class distribution: 63% CKD, 37% NOTCKD.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - 80% of time dedicated to data preparation.
  - Cleaning, removing missing values, and formatting for SVM compatibility.
  - Utilization of Data Mining (DM) tools for real-time data analysis.

- **Training and Testing Data:**
  - Model training and testing under varied SVM parameter conditions.
  - Aim for maximum accuracy.
  - 70:30 split for training and testing, respectively.
  - Provision for algorithm improvisation if needed.

- **Results and Analysis:**
  - Evaluation based on parameters:
    - **Precision:**
      - Fraction of retrieved data useful for the query.
    - **Recall:**
      - Fraction of relevant data effectively retrieved.
    - **F-measure:**
      - A measure combining precision and recall.
    - **Accuracy:**
      - Proximity of computation to true value.
      - Calculated using true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative.

This plan outlines the data collection, preprocessing steps, training/testing procedures, and parameters used for evaluating the proposed model's results in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.
